## Opening Paraview

We'll start by opening Paraview. Assuming you have installed Paraview,
click on the Paraview icon. On MacOS, this will be in the Applications
folder, ie.

![Paraview in applications folder]({{ page.root }}/fig/applications-paraview.jpg){: width="45%" }

Once started, you should see the Paraview application Window:

![Paraview main window]({{ page.root }}/fig/paraview-main-window.jpg){: width="75%" }

The four main sections of the application window are highlighed above.

### The pipeline browser

This displays the processing pipeline in a tree view. Each data source will be
a `root', with filters as seperate or connected branches. It is interactive,
allowing you to hide or show the results of filters. This will be discussed
later in the lesson.
